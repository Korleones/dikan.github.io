# IELTS Task 1: Data Description Lexicon

As a computer engineer, I treat the IELTS Writing Task 1 as a data visualization and feature extraction problem. Below is a curated "API Documentation" of high-level English expressions for describing dynamic trends and fluctuations.

---

## 1. Data Initialization (Start Points)
*How to describe the initial state of a variable.*

| Expression | Logic / Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Commence from a low base of...** | Ideal for technologies starting from near-zero (e.g., Internet). |
| **The initial figure for [X] stood at...** | A professional way to state the first data point. |
| **Start at a relatively modest [Number]** | Used when the starting value is low but not negligible. |

* **Example:** "The proportion of Internet users **commenced from a low base** of only 10% in 1995."

---

## 2. Gradient & Trajectory (Trend & Slope)
*Describing the first derivative ($f'(x)$) and the velocity of growth.*

| Expression | Logic / Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Maintain a steady upward trajectory** | Linear growth with a constant positive slope. |
| **Experience a sharp acceleration** | When the slope increases significantly (d2y/dx2 > 0). |
| **Growth gained momentum after...** | Used for a turning point where growth becomes faster. |
| **Skyrocket / Surge / Soar** | Describing exponential-like growth or high-velocity surges. |

* **Example:** "While washing machines showed a **steady upward trajectory**, phone ownership **gained significant momentum** after 1997."

---

## 3. Comparison & Intersection (Relative Movement)
*Describing the interaction between two or more variables.*

| Expression | Logic / Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narrow / Close the gap** | When the distance between two lines decreases. |
| **Widen the gap** | When the divergence between two datasets increases. |
| **Effectively overtake / Surpass** | A critical intersection point where values cross. |
| **Effectively eclipse [X]** | To surpass [X] by a large margin, making it secondary. |

* **Example:** "By 1999, phone ownership **effectively eclipsed** computer ownership, **narrowing the gap** with washing machines to just 10%."

---

## 4. Exception Handling (Anomaly & Fluctuation)
*Describing non-monotonic behavior or unexpected dips.*

| Expression | Logic / Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Buck the general trend** | When one category behaves differently from the rest. |
| **Experience a marginal dip** | A small, temporary decrease in value. |
| **Undergo a temporary decline before recovering** | A classic 'V-shaped' recovery pattern. |
| **Regain momentum / Rebound** | Returning to a growth state after a dip or plateau. |

* **Example:** "The DVD player **bucked the general trend** by **undergoing a marginal dip** in 1996 before **regaining its momentum**."

---

## 5. Global Feature Selection (Overview)
*High-level summary phrases for the 'Overview' paragraph.*

| Expression | Logic / Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **It is manifest that...** | A more formal alternative to "It is clear that". |
| **[X] emerged as the dominant category...** | Highlighting the leader of the dataset. |
| **The most striking feature is...** | Pointing out the most significant data anomaly or trend. |
| **Exhibit a consistent upward trend** | Summarizing a general positive correlation over time. |

## 🛠️ Debugging Checklist for Writing
- [ ] **Tense Consistency:** Ensure the use of **Simple Past** for historical data.
- [ ] **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Watch out for collective nouns like "Percentage of...".
- [ ] **Lexical Diversity:** Avoid repeating "increase"; switch to "climb", "rise", or "grow".
- [ ] **Spelling Accuracy:** Scan for "Environment", "Government", and "Technology".

This is a blog to track the learning path for me and Holly, who are eager to refine our linguistic ability and add some fun to the tedious life. I am interested in Cantonese， Japanese and Holly loves Shanghainese. I will write down what we learned every day(hopefully) to help us review and visualize our study. Quite meaningful right? Not only practise my language but also eventually build something for my own fun. Vamous!

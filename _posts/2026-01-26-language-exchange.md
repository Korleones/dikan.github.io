This is a blog to track the learning path for me and Holly, who are eager to refine our linguistic ability and add some fun to the tedious life. I am interested in Cantonese, Japanese and Holly loves Shanghainese. I will write down what we learned every day(hopefully) to help us review and visualize our study. Quite meaningful right? Not only practise my language but also eventually build something for my own fun. Vamous!

### 📖 Root Analysis 

#### 1. Root: -CUR- / -COURS-
* **Etymology:** Derived from Latin *currere*, meaning **"To run / To flow"**.

| Word | Morphological Breakdown | Definition (CS/Technical Context) | Typical Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current** | `cur` (run/flow) + `ent` (adj. suffix) | **Present; Ongoing** | `Current branch` (The branch you are currently working on). |
| **Concurrent** | `con` (together) + `cur` (run) | **Running together / Parallel** | `Concurrency` in C++, referring to multiple threads running simultaneously. |

---

#### 2. Root: -PON- / -POS- / -POUND-

* **Etymology:** Derived from Latin *ponere*, meaning **"To put / To place / To set"**.
* **Engineering Intuition:** Visualize "Setting a state," "Storing assets," or "Placing components" into a architecture.

| Word | Morphological Breakdown | Definition (CS/Technical Context) | Typical Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Repository** | `re` (back/store) + `pos` (place) | **A place where things are stored** | `Git Repo`: The physical/logical location where code assets are placed. |

---
#### 3. Root: -GEN-
**Etymology:** Derived from Greek *genos* and Latin *genus*, meaning **“Birth / Origin / Kind / Race”**.  
**Engineering Intuition:** Visualize **"Creation"** and **"Type"**—the mechanism that spawns new instances or defines the nature of a class/category.

| Word | Morphological Breakdown | Definition (CS/Technical Context) | Typical Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Generate** | gen (birth) + ate (verb suffix) | To produce or create | **Code Generation**: Tools that automatically write boilerplate code. |
| **Generic** | gen (kind) + ic (adj. suffix) | Relating to a whole group/type | **Generics in C++**: Using templates to write code that works with any data type. |

#### 💡 工程师的联想笔记：

1. **Generative AI:** 现在的 LLM（大语言模型）被称为 **Generative**，核心就在于它的 **-GEN-** 能力——不是在搜索，而是在“从无到有”地创造（Birth/Origin）内容。
2. **Generic Programming:** 迪，你在写 C++ Template 时，本质上是在定义一个 **Generic** (Kind) 逻辑，直到实例化时才真正 **Generate** (Birth) 出具体的函数。
3. **Entropy vs. Degeneracy:** 在算法优化中，如果一个复杂的结构退化成了最简单的形态，我们称之为 **Degenerate**，就像复杂的逻辑流最后降级成了一个简单的 `if-else`。
